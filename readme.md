Compressible Flow Calculator

This program was built to solve problems relating to compressible flow aerodynamics, specifically: isentropic flow with area change,
normal and oblique shock analysis, and Prandtl-Meyer expansions. Currently, only a command line is supported, but I have interest in
adding a GUI later.
